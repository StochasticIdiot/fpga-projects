## Wiki, Pages or Jekyll?
(Home)[index.md]

Github offers multiple alternatives for documentation. Certainly I just discovered Jekyll and,
if I'm not wrong, it seems a tool to manage a blog which can be integrated with Gitub pages.
And it even allows comments! The problem is that I don't quite understand how to set it up,
it doesn't seem too complicated but I don't have time to look it up now. Maybe in some days
I take a look at it.

Then theres the wiki and pages, at the end they are quite similar and I'm not sure about the
differences. For now I believe a wiki is a more general way to document the repository while
pages are documents within the repository that can be used to document it.

This entry has no purpose other than share my thoughs and kind of list the different alternatives
I have. For now I won't use Jekyll and keep using pages to keep a kind of a blog with the progresses
I'm doing, problems I encounter or ideas I have. Then I reserve wikis for more serious documentation
about the projects I do, how do they work, how to set them up or run them, etc. So pages will be
like a diary and the wiki, if I ever write it, could be like the final report.

I'm not saying this is the best way of doing things, but that's how I will do it. And I want to
keep it written so I'm not constantly changing my mind. At the end this is just a very informal blog,
mostly for my personal use.
