## FPGA-Projects

I started playing with the Terasic DE0-nano board which has a Cyclone IV FPGA from Altera (now Intel). Everything is wonderful until you try to do something and it doesn't work. I was using Quartus 13.1 which was working fine but this version is quite old and I wanted to use the last version (currently 20.1.1), and that's when the nightmare began.

There are things that work and there are things that need some magical setup in order to work. Then I decided to start documenting all the magical stuff so, if I need to do it again, I have it everything in one place. Also I would like to use scripts so I can avoid using Quartus GUI and the Nios Software Builder as much as possible. Specially the Nios Software Builder which crashes a lot.

At the end this will be like a documentation hub where I will describe the setup and scripts and I may also use it as a blog and post ideas or updates about other FPGA projects I'm working on.
