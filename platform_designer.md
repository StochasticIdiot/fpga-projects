## Schr√∂dinger PLL
Let's start with a mysterious thing, in Quartus 20.1 I can't instantiate a PLL in the Platform Designer. I can add it,
configure it and then when the configuration is done and I click finish to close the configuration window... Puff! it
dissapears. The weird thing is that yesterday it worked and I could instantiate it (though I didn't test if it actually
worke).

As far as I know, I haven't changed anything related to Quartus or Platform Design so I'm lost and don't know why
something that worked once it is no longer working.
